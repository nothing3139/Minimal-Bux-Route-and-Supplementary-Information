This small repository contains the Python Code used to generate the result shown in the Google Docs.
The main file used is minbux.py, the other files (buxforallpu.py and buxforallgolfers:hats.py) are derived from minbux.py, so they aren't properly documented.
(Note that I'm well aware that the code is quite unoptimized.)
